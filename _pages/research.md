Single Electrons on Solid Neon
======
Electrons trapped on cryogenic noble gas substrate, such as helium and neon, are promising candidates for ideal quantum bits (qubits). In a groundbreaking achievement, I experimentally realized the first-ever single-electron qubit on solid neon â€“ introducing a fundamentally new quantum platform. This qubit has already demonstrated exceptional performance, rivaling the superconducting qubit systems that have been intensely studied for over two decades. 
Key advantages of this platform include a remarkably long coherence time of 0.1 ms, high-fidelity single-shot readout (98.1%), high-fidelity single-qubit gate operation (99.97%) and two-qubit coupling. Leveraging the pristine nature of solid neon, this system holds great potential as a foundation for building a general-purpose quantum computer.
These breakthrough findings were published in Nature (605, 46 (2022)) and Nature Physics (20, 116 (2024)), with me as the first author. The work was widely recognized and highlighted by major internationally media outlets, including DOE Science Headlines, Argonne National Laboratory News, Yahoo, IEEE Spectrum, UChicago News, EurekAlert!, and Phys.org.
